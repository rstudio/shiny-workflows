      # > If the workflow run is a re-run, with debugging enabled, then it opens a tmate shell that you can ssh into for interactive debugging.
      # > It uses https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate internally.
      # Usage:
      # * Add your SSH key to your GitHub account. This action does not work without an SSH key.
      # * If a workflow run fails, on the web UI select a re-run and turn on debug logging.
      # * Wait until the workflow output tells you that the tmate shell is ready, and copy paste the random hostname.
      # * Use ssh to log in to the VM.
